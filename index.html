      <p>Dear Gabriella</p>
      <p>
        you stole my heart but I'll let you keep it,i just wanted to tell you that when you feel sad remember that you have me ok? i will always be by your side and i will never let you go.Every day with you feels like a beautiful adventure, filled with laughter, love, and moments that I never want to forget. You bring so much happiness and warmth into my life, and I'm endlessly grateful for everything you are. Just knowing you're by my side makes everything feel brighter and more meaningful,and Iâ€™m so lucky to get to share my days with you.You are my everything,i love u baby.
